# Moltres Project

SDL2 Project
Uses SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_gfx.

Under Linux and apt package manager...
You can run the following command to install the packages:

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

Windows...a bit more complicated.
